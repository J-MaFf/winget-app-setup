.SYNOPSIS
 Installs a list of programs using winget.

.DESCRIPTION
 This script installs a curated list of programs from winget. The authoritative
 list is returned by Get-DefaultAppCatalog (WingetAppSetup/Public/AppCatalog.ps1,
 inlined below in this generated file) and shared with winget-app-uninstall.ps1.
 Run the script with -WhatIf to preview the exact set of planned installs without
 making any system changes.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
 When specified, performs all pre-flight checks and displays planned actions without making any system changes.

.PARAMETER SkipSystemCheck
 Bypasses the pre-flight system checks (OS version, disk space, network) for headless or automated use.

.PARAMETER NonInteractive
 Suppresses the interactive extras for unattended runs (RMM, CI, scheduled tasks): the summary
 grid-view window and the final "press any key to exit". Also auto-detected when the session is
 non-interactive or stdin is redirected. The installer asks no yes/no questions on any path (issue
 #230), so this switch is only about those two extras - it is not needed to keep a run from
 blocking on a prompt.
